# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued my progress on the Udemy Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp - Section 23 (Blog Website Challenge). Set up the home, about, contact, and compose pages of the website and began creating a form for creating blog posts.

**Thoughts:** It's been a while since I last worked with EJS and Express, so I initially struggled to remember how to do things, but it eventually started to come back to me after playing around with it!


### Day 2: October 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished creating the Blog Website Challenge using Express & EJS! It now has a compose button, routing parameters for the different posts, and truncated post previews on the home page.

**Thoughts:** I'm getting the hang of EJS and Express again, so today went smoother than yesterday. I'd never worked with routing parameters before, so that was something new I learned today. The "blog" currently doesn't have any database functionality, so none of the posts save when the server is re-started. In the future, I plan on implementing a database through MongoDB to save the posts.

### Day 3: October 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned the basics of SQL and MongoDB. Practiced making some databases on a local server.

**Thoughts:** MongoDB is pretty new to me, so there was a bit of a learning curve getting everything set up, but I'm excited for the different projects I can make with this!

### Day 4: October 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a "to-do" list web app with MongoDB database integrations. This is a version of an old to-do list web app project, but now it has a database so the to-do list items get saved!

**Thoughts:** Starting to get the hang of MongoDB & Mongoose, not 100% comfortable with it though.
