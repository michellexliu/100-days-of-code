# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued my progress on the Udemy Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp - Section 23 (Blog Website Challenge). Set up the home, about, contact, and compose pages of the website and began creating a form for creating blog posts.

**Thoughts:** It's been a while since I last worked with EJS and Express, so I initially struggled to remember how to do things, but it eventually started to come back to me after playing around with it!


### Day 2: October 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished creating the Blog Website Challenge using Express & EJS! It now has a compose button, routing parameters for the different posts, and truncated post previews on the home page.

**Thoughts:** I'm getting the hang of EJS and Express again, so today went smoother than yesterday. I'd never worked with routing parameters before, so that was something new I learned today. The "blog" currently doesn't have any database functionality, so none of the posts save when the server is re-started. In the future, I plan on implementing a database through MongoDB to save the posts.

### Day 3: October 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned the basics of SQL and MongoDB. Practiced making some databases on a local server.

**Thoughts:** MongoDB is pretty new to me, so there was a bit of a learning curve getting everything set up, but I'm excited for the different projects I can make with this!

### Day 4: October 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a "to-do" list web app with MongoDB database integrations. This is a version of an old to-do list web app project, but now it has a database so the to-do list items get saved!

**Thoughts:** Starting to get the hang of MongoDB & Mongoose, not 100% comfortable with it though.

### Day 5/6: October 24-25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my project for Technica, the largest all women and non-binary hackathon! Check it out here: http://journlyapp.herokuapp.com/.

**Thoughts:** This was a really fun experience, and I got to put the MongoDB & Node.js I've been learning lately into use! I struggled initially to set up the user database and authentication system, but I'm pretty happy with how everything turned out :)

### Day 7: October 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made some updates to my personal website: added a tab for 100 days of code and added Journly to the project gallery.

**Thoughts:** Taking it easy today to cool down from the hackathon and catch up on schoolwork, so I didn't do as much coding as the other days. Hopefully will be back on track and continue the Udemy course tomorrow!

### Day 8: October 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made a Twitter bot with Tweepy and started learning React.

**Thoughts:** Oops missed a few days :( starting to get back into it though & am excited to learn more React!

### Day 9: November 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed most of the [tic tac toe tutorial!](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) on the React website!

**Thoughts:** Still don't completely understand how React components and props work, but I think I'm starting to get the hang of it! It's really cool to see all the things React can do and am super excited to start implementing it into my personal projects :)
